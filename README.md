tetris game using c++ and opengl

this a game I wrote when i were a freshman so it look very trash, but u can run it so please don't judge me. Just install opengl and click on Project -> Property -> Configuration 
Manager -> change the active solution to x86.
The include<glut.h> is in collision.h file.
